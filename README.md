# Skyrim-Alchemy-Ingredient-Script

### by Timothy Moore

This is a Python program I wrote for finding ingredient combinations in Skyrim. The program parses the text file alchemy.txt which contains formatted data about all the base ingredients and their effects. 

A class alchemy contains Python dictionaries that store the data from the text file so that it can be manipulated to generate useful information. 

The functions getEffects, getIngredients, findSingleEffects, and findEffects all provide different lists of formatted information that help with quality of life when practicing alchemy in game.
